# Ryze-Tello-Follow-Me-Drone
This project aims at developing a program for the Ryze Tello drone 
to detect and follow faces. It is using the pid controller to control
the drone and the OpenCV CascadeClassifier for detecting the faces.
I am currently working on a version using a Model build in PyTorch 
using transfer learning to detect the faces.
